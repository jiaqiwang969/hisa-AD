# WENO Test Cases

Test cases for individual functions (unit tests) as well as 
tests for the complete scheme (integration tests). All tests are 
managed with the software Catch2 and are compiled into one executable
the different tests can then be run individually by selecting the 
appropiate tags. To list all available tags use:

    tests.exe -t 

For further information about command line arguments in Catch2 use 

    tests.exe -?

## Run All Tests

With `runTest <Option>` the test cases can be run together. 

Use `runTest --runAll` to run all test cases and generate a small test report in 
report/testReport.html
View the report with your browser, e.g.: `firefox report/testReport.html`

Use `runTest --runSimple` to run a reduced set of test cases. Suitable for a quick check 
without generating a test report 

## Included Tests

Currently these tests are available

1. geometryWENO Class
	A test function for the Jacobian and the gaussQuad function is provided. 
    Run with `WENO_TEST [baseTest]` in the 2DMesh case directory.
2. WENOBase Class
    Check IO functionality of reading and writing lists
    Execute in 2DMesh case directory with `WENO_TEST [IOTest]`
3. WENOUpwindFit
	An integration test to compare the result of the WENO scheme to the linear scheme
	for the calculation of the divergence of a scalar field. 
    This can be executed for all the different mesh cases to check the effect of boundaries
4. Advection test case
	Test the WENOUpwindFit scheme by using the test case, the rotation of a slotted disk, 
	designed by Zalesak [1]
>    [1] Zalesak, S.T. Fully Multidimensional Flux-Corrected 	Algorithms
        for Fluids. J. Comput. Phys. 1979, 31, 335â€“362.

5. GlobalFvMesh test case
    Test if the mapping of global to local cellID and reverse is correct. As this test
    is done in parallel it is not included in the Catch2 environment but uses 
    FatalError statements to print out error messages

## Mesh Study

To generate a small mesh study of the implemented WENO scheme the script
`WENOEXT/tests/Case/runMeshStudy.sh` can be executed. It runs on the 2D mesh 
the WENOUpwindFit test case for a 50x50, 100x100, 150x150 mesh storing the results
in a file. The results can be plotted with the gnuplot script provided in the same 
directory.
